## General Information
 Coop will assist farmers to find potential buyers of their produce. The farmer will make a call to an administrator at AMUCOS to register
 his/her produce in thier database. Buyers will then be able to browse the produce in the database and if interested in a particular produce they will 
 call AMUCOS for details. As part of recording the produce for sale the produce type is required. For example cereal, root crop or legume.
 The produce name will also be recorded like cassava, peas, beans. In addition there are features like 'Baged','Cleaned'and 'Quantity'
 associated with all the produce. It will also be possible to determine whether a produce is registered or not, the farmers name and contact information.
 The user will aslo be able to upload one or more photos for the produce , sort and filter the produce. There will be two roles for authorisation,the AMUCOS personnel
 and Admin. A report of produce sales by produc type can be displayed in a pie chart so anyone with admin acess can view this report. In addition someone who has not logged in
 they will only be able to browse the produce.
