# Coop
> I will be building a Web application for a Cooperative Union in Uganda called AMUCOS to assist with thier marketing efforts by using Angular 2 on the client side
> to build forms and 
> ASP.NET Core on the server side and Entity Framework Core for the database. The application will be centered around CRUD, filtering, sorting and pagination, handling and logging errors
> toast notifications, authentification and authorisation and preventing CSRF attacks. The application will have a simple UI and not something that is visually outstanding
> 
> Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com). <!-- If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->

## General Information
 Coop will assist farmers to find potential buyers of their produce. The farmer will make a call to an administrator at AMUCOS to register
 his/her produce in thier database. Buyers will then be able to browse the produce in the database and if interested in a particular produce they will 
 call AMUCOS for details. Records of the produce type will be taken for example cereal, root crop or legume as well as 
 the produce name like cassava, peas, beans. In addition there are features like baged,cleaned and quantity
 associated with all the produce which will aslo be recorded. The user will be able to upload one or more photos for the produce , sort and filter the produce.
 There will be two roles for authorisation,the AMUCOS personnel
 and the admin. A report of produce sales can be displayed in a pie chart so anyone with admin access can view this report. In addition someone who has not logged in will only be able to browse the produce.
